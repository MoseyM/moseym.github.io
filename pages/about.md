<p>
    I am self-characterized as unconventional (in theory). I am a fullstack developer who enjoys doing a variety of things. I wanted to start documenting my findings, some quick tricks that I have learned along the way and the likes. So why not with a Jekyll blog. You should expect clean, bloat-free, lightly comedic posts (or possibly have no expectations, makes it more interesting)
