<p>This is my alternative cover letter. Below I will discuss, briefly, who I am and a little bit about my story, my key skills, ultimately what I bring to the table. My expectation is that you, the reader, will result in having a clearer idea as to whether or not I will be a possible fit for the applied position.</p>

<h4>Who I Am/My Story</h4>

<p>My story in web development started in early 2014. I began as a self taught developer. I began with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After getting into PHP, I realized I had a genuine interest and passion to build web applications so I enrolled into a fullstack bootcamp. I began working professionally late 2014 and the rest is history. Tech is ever changing so I am constantly looking at new tech, learning new concepts and languages.</p>

<h4>Key Skills</h4>

<p><span class="post-link" style="font-weight: bold;">PHP</span> – I have been coding with PHP since 2014. I have an in-depth knowledge of Object Oriented Programming. Coding in just vanilla PHP has not been as frequent as working with frameworks. I have built example MVC with PHP alone but professionally I have worked under model-view-controller frameworks. This includes coding and deeply knowing the following frameworks:

<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Laravel 5.0+</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Drupal 7</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Joomla</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Magento 1.9</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Lumen</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><span class="post-link" style="font-weight: bold;">JavaScript</span> – With respect to web applications, one cannot build user-friendly, engaging and responsive user interfaces today without the use of JavaScript. I have worked with React but mostly vanilla js. Besides the libraries, I have built functionality using vanilla JavaScript (not the library). I have built and used API's. The idea of contracts within asynchronous coding is not unfamiliar to me.</p>

<p><span class="post-link" style="font-weight: bold;">CSS/SASS/LESS</span> – Styling with SASS and LESS are more enjoyable compared to CSS. I suppose it can be compared to using jQuery vs JavaScript. I understand the power, ease and convenience with using SASS and LESS.</p>
