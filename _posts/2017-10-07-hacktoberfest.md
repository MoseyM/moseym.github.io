#### The What ####

**Hacktoberfest**: is an event that occurs during the month of October where you are tasked in one way or another to contribute to open source software. Really from what I gather, you are helping solve issues or optimize the existing functionality of an application. 

The idea of taking valuable time out of my day(s) to work on something for no monetary benefit doesn't feel quite right with me, hence my initial apprehension on even getting involved with open, I mean I'm just being honest here. **However** I use opensource software _a lot_. This is not to say I _owe_ anyone anything but the fact remains, I could shed a couple of hours to give back.

#### The Why ####

* **_Its a learning experience._** I will seek out projects that are geared toward what I want to learn instead of what I already know. This way, i can get real application experience in either a language or something I may only know through textbooks or hello-world examples. There isn't this huge expectation to _get it done_ so I am more willing to take my time and learn which is great. 
* **_Looks good on your Github that you contribute to opensource._** Obviously, you want something out of this and I feel this is a decent tradeoff. You are able to broadcast your conributions to the world. This could mean to recruiters or potential employers or just to the industry. It opens doors to other possibilities and connections as well as let people in the industry know who you are (this sounds so much more grandioso than it probably is but hopefully the point is made).



I guess the saying, "better late than never," rings pretty clear here. I have been hearing for years now how **we** should all be helping open source. I suppose, this was due in my own time. There are a ton of projects with issues to get read thru so on that note, I shall begin.
