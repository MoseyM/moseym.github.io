 <p>Ah, the age old idiom, “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” I've heard this my whole life, well this one and, “Life isn't fair” which tend to be what follows my occasional, “That's not fair” statement. I grew up with the belief that life wasn't fair. Now, don't get me wrong, I know life isn't a fairytale where a happy ending is the norm. I also know, well now I do, that life is what ever you make of it. If life isn't fair for YOU make it fair. Same with the lemons analogy. Some may say that this idiom means to be grateful for what you have. This is true, but this idiom also means, to me, that you have to occasionally settle to allow for such gratefulness.</p>

  <span class="intist">Huh?</span>

  <p>Ok, so what I mean is we are taught to be grateful for what we receive but sometimes this means you also have to acknowledge that you may be able to do better but can't obtain that better-ness so as a compromise to prevent any amount of misery you shift your thoughts to gratefulness. For example think, you have a job, you're not happy at your job but, well, at least you have one, some don't have a job, be grateful. Instead you could consider that you control your career so create an exit strategy, build your skills in a subject that aligns best with where you want to be to make yourself more marketable. Another example, you have a car that's only partly dependable? The lemonade could be at least you have a car, you could be catching the bus or worse not have any other transportation options. Or you could sell the car, save your money and buy a more dependable car. </p>
    
  <span class="intist">There's this idea of being “okay” with good enough and for me this in itself is not “good enough”</span>

  <p>"When life gives me lemons...", more like "when I shape my life in a way that warrants lemons". I live thinking that I am the ruler of my world. I have complete control over my life direction. If I don't take schooling seriously, how on earth can I expect to perform well in school to receive the knowledge I need to excel in the field I want? How can I wake up one day and be overweight without knowing that my decisions to eat unhealthy food and cease physical activity over an extended amount of time was the cause? Life isn't this abstract, random unknown that throws unpredictable instances in your path, this is what is expected by your own actions. Life is not happening to you. This is similar to the 'Law of Attraction', that of which you're attracting is identical to what you emit.</p>

  <p>Living intentionally is really what I am getting at. The real truth is make intentional, conscious actions to move you in the direction you desire. Life doesn't give what you aren't requesting. All in all just check your emotions, be clear with who you truly are and your real emotions. Be proactive don't react to Life, make Life what you want.</p>
