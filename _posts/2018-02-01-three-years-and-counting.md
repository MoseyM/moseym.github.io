<p>I decided to become a developer in January of 2014. I was working as a customer service supervisor, getting my hands on exposure to the real workings of a small business. It was great but ultimately, I knew I wasn't really growing as a professional. I was just coasting. I wasn't tremendously unhappy but I wasn't content either. </p>

<!--more-->
<p>I worked until 4 in the afternoon and only lived 2 miles away from work. As imagined, I was very spoiled when it came to transit and time. So after work, I would go to my nearest library and work through the, then free, courses on Codecademy. I did this for about two months, an hour or two a day when I decided that I wanted to take the next step. I attended a coding bootcamp and the rest is history. I started working professionally around Easter 2015.</p>

<p>Below are some things I realized during this short time in my career. That I wanted to write about and share.</p>

<span class="intist">The pay that most camps or schools advertise are very much inflated.</span> 
<p>Unless you are incredibly gifted, contribute to open source applications or you're just a very proactive developing prodigy you shouldn't expect to prepare for retiriment in your first job. Keep in mind, the most experience you have the more valued you are, this is given you take the employee-for-life-then-retire life.</p>

<span class="intist">If you aren't learning anything new you are hurting yourself.</span> 
<p>This industry changes way too much to stay stagnant. Even if you enjoy what you do, there are so many interesting things going on. I am always pushing myself to do more, learn something new every year. Just get more knowledge in whatever field you choose. Never be that person that is doing the same thing every day all day every year. Ultimately, you are cheating yourself on all things that will make you MORE valuable in the marketplace. Change can be a great thing, if you are intentional. Its very easy to get comfortable but that is something you never want to do especially in Tech.</p>

<span class="intist">There are too many opportunities to hate your job or stay stuck, move around and prosper.</span> 
<p>Of course, have an exit strategy once you're ready to cross that bridge. To stay at a job longterm with no plans, hating every second is theft against yourself. You can do contracting, remote, freelancing, ENTREPRENEURSHIP. Being a slave to the dollar will only benefit the employer not yourself. Be prepared to hustle but always seek happiness in your endeavors. </p>
<p>Its been three years and counting but I am eager and moving with intentional feet. I have seen what development could be as a career. My journey is so far from done but I wanted to reflect and share these points. Until next time...</p>
