Recently I learned about [R](https://www.r-project.org/ "rlang link") and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com "rstudio link"). This was an interesting piece of programming for me to get exposed to. I attended a class on web scraping (*short, sweet definition - a way of taking information from a website*). R is technically, used for statistics from what I have learned. It is one of the languages used for data visualization.

Some basic things that I did with R was grab all occurences of a sepecific element, like div's. I would also try out some looping, where you could get all the divs dynamically by capturing a attribute from a child link. 

It is a lot more interesting and powerful then I am able, with my experience in it, to explain. However, check out this small snippet of code that I used for --insert web url here--
    `<div>blah</div`
